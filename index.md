# Evidence synthesis and review drafting support — delivered with an audit trail

A private, consultation-gated service supporting academic and R&D teams with rigorous literature analysis, structured synthesis, and manuscript-ready tables/figures.

**Typical outputs**
- Evidence maps and thematic syntheses across large corpora
- Draft-ready outlines and section drafts for reviews and technical reports
- Publication-quality figures/tables (with editable sources where possible)
- Reference libraries (BibTeX/RIS/EndNote) plus a clear evidence trail

**How access works:** request discussion → scoping call → written proposal → delivery.  
**Start here →** [Request a discussion](/request/) • [Services](/services/) • [How it works](/how-it-works/)
