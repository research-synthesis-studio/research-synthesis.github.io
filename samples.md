# Sample outputs

Examples are illustrative and created from public literature (no client material).

- Evidence map / thematic structure figure (example)
- Evidence matrix/table excerpt (example)
- Draft outline excerpt (example)

If you want, I can share a fuller redacted example pack after an initial discussion.
