## What to include in the intake

The form asks about:
- Your name and organisation
- Topic / field and primary goal
- Timeline or deadlines
- What materials you already have (seed papers, draft, library, etc.)
- Preferred type of support
- Any constraints (e.g., specific databases, confidentiality, AI tool preferences)

After you submit the form:
1) We review your responses (usually within 48 hours).  
2) If it’s a good fit, we schedule a short scoping call.  
3) You receive a written proposal with scope, timeline, and deliverables.

We aim for a clear and professional process; structured intake helps keep discussions focused and efficient.
