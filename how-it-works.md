# How it works

1) **Request discussion** — brief intake (topic, goal, deadline, constraints)  
2) **Scoping call** — confirm fit, deliverables, timeline  
3) **Written proposal** — fixed scope, milestones, and a delivery plan  
4) **Delivery** — drafts + figures/tables + references + evidence trail

## Research integrity and disclosure
- All outputs are **traceable to sources** (references + an evidence trail).
- Text is **original synthesis**; no plagiarism.
- Authorship/acknowledgement follow **ICMJE/COPE-aligned norms**. Authorship is only appropriate when criteria are met.
- Any use of AI-assisted tooling (if applicable) can be documented to match the norms of the target venue and institution.

## Confidentiality
Work is handled confidentially by default. Data handling and retention/deletion are agreed at kickoff.

## What this service is not
- Not a public SaaS platform.
- Not “guaranteed publication.”
- Not undisclosed ghost authorship.
