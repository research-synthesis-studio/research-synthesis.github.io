# Services

Work is consultation-gated and scoped upfront. Each engagement includes references and an evidence trail (search terms, inclusion rules, and synthesis notes as appropriate).

## Rapid Landscape (1–2 weeks)
For fast, defensible orientation to a field.
- Theme map + key papers (seminal and recent)
- Curated reading list + annotated bibliography
- 1–2 summary figures (e.g., trend map / topic structure)
- Reference library (BibTeX/RIS)

## Structured Review Build (3–6 weeks)
For review-article drafts and high-quality background sections.
- Agreed search and screening plan (lightweight protocol-style if needed)
- Evidence matrix/table(s) with clear definitions
- Detailed outline + section drafts (clearly marked as draft text)
- Figures/tables + reference library + evidence trail appendix

## Revision & Evidence Upgrade (1–3 weeks)
For strengthening an existing manuscript or report.
- Structural and citation-level strengthening (what’s missing and why)
- Targeted additions of key evidence
- 1–2 new visuals/tables where helpful
- Revision memo + tracked changes

**Optional add-ons**
- Expanded database coverage (domain-dependent)
- Additional figures/tables
- Ongoing monthly evidence briefs (retainer)
