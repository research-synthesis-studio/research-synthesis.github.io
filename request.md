# Request a discussion

Access is consultation-gated to keep work rigorous and confidential.

**Email:** `hello@YOURDOMAIN` *(replace)*  
Or link an intake form here (Google Form / Formspree).

## What to include (copy/paste is fine)
- Topic/field and the intended output (review, grant, technical report, etc.)
- Deadline and any internal milestones
- Whether you have seed papers, an existing library, or a draft manuscript
- Preferred synthesis type (narrative, scoping-style, structured review)
- Any constraints (databases, languages, confidentiality)

If it’s a good fit, the next step is a short scoping call followed by a written proposal.
